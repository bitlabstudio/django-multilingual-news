Django Multilingual News
========================

A reusable Django app for managing news/blog entries in different languages.

Comes with a django-cms apphook and has been prepared using Django 1.5.1 and
django-cms 2.4.1.

This app is based on the great https://github.com/fivethreeo/cmsplugin-blog
and re-used some of it's snippets.

------------

    $ pip install django-multilingual-news

If you feel adventurous and want to install the latest commit from GitHub::

Usage
-----

Using the apphook

Simply create a django-cms page and select it in the ``Application`` field of
the ``Advanced Settings``.

Template tags
+++++++++++++

We provide a template tag to render the news entry's placeholder. First import
the tag library, then add the tag plus arguments::

    {% load multilingual_news_tags %}
    {% render_news_placeholder NEWS_ENTRY_OBJECT OPTIONAL_PLACEHOLDER_SLOT OPTIONAL_TRUNCATION %}

To render the first non-empty placeholder (e.g. if the excerpt is empty)::

    {% render_news_placeholder news_entry %}

To render the ``excerpt``::

    {% render_news_placeholder news_entry 'excerpt' %}

To render the ``content``::

    {% render_news_placeholder news_entry 'content' %}

To render and truncate the ``content`` (10 words)::

    {% render_news_placeholder news_entry 'content' 10 %}

To render and truncate the first non-empty placeholder (20 words)::

    {% render_news_placeholder news_entry 20 %}
